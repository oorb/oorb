#
# OpenOrb Build System
#
# This file and its companion in build/Makefile define build targets for all
# command line executables (see PROGRAMS in ../make.config), liboorb
# libraries, and the pyoorb Python module.  Default rule (named `all`)
# builds all of them.
#
# Example usage (with -j4 to take advantage of multi-threaded builds):
#
#	$ make -j4
#
# or (for example) to just build oorb, run:
#
#	$ make -j4 oorb
#
# To install the code, run:
#
#	$ make install
#
# This will install OpenOrb to whatever you specified as --prefix when
# running configure, and pyoorb to the standard modules location (i.e., the
# "site-path") of python used to build pyoorb.  The location where pyoorb is
# installed can be given explicitly via the PYTHON_SITE_PATH environmental
# variable.
#
# FOR DEVELOPERS:
#
# * The build is executed in the build/ subdirectory.  All intermediate
#   files end up there (.o, .mod, etc.)
#
# * To add new programs, add the .f90 file into main/ and list it in
#   PROGRAMS variable in make.config. Then rerun `make depends`.
#
# * To add new files, add them to modules/ or classes/ and list the file
#   name in the apropriate variable in make.config.  Then rerun `make
#   depends`
#
# * If there's a change in depdendency of any FORTRAN file (e.g., you've
#   USEd another module), run:
#
#       $ make depends
#
#   to rebuild the dependencies file (build/make.depends).  You must be
#   using gfortran for this rebuild to work.
