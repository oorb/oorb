OpenOrb Python wrappers.


To build, cd into this directory and then
    shell> make clean
    shell> make
    shell> python setup.py install

Test by running
    shell> python api.py

If you get an error from python saying that liboorb cannot be found, copy
liboorb.so (or liboorb.dylib if you are on a Mac) somewhere in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH if you are on a Mac).


Tested on a Mac OS X system running OSX 10.5.x and gfortran 4.4.x

These wrappers are not in their final version and so they should not be used in
production software. You have been warned!
