# Introduction #

OOrb contains, e.g., the statistical orbital ranging method (hereafter
referred to as Ranging). Ranging is used to solve the orbital inverse
problem of computing non-Gaussian orbital-element probability density
functions (p.d.f.s) based on input astrometry.

Ranging is optimized for cases where the amount of astrometry is
scarce or spans a relatively short time span. Ranging-based methods
have successfully been applied to a variety of different topics such
as rigorous ephemeris prediction, orbital-element-distribution studies
for trans-neptunian objects, the computation of invariant collision
probabilities between NEOs and the Earth, detecting linkages between
astrometric asteroid observations within an apparition as well as
between apparitions, and in the rigorous analysis of the impact of
orbital arc-length and/or astrometric uncertainty on the uncertainty
of the resulting orbits.

In OOrb, tools for making ephemeris predictions and classification of
objects (i.e., NEO-MBO-TNO) are also available.

# Installation using `conda` #

The easiest way to install OOrb on Linux and OSX 64-bit systems is using the
conda installer, which requires some form of this package manager to be
installed on your system (e.g., conda, anaconda, miniconda):

```bash
conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge openorb
```

For more details on the OOrb conda package please refer to [this
website](https://github.com/conda-forge/openorb-feedstock).

## Installing additional ephemerides files ##

OpenOrb comes with JPL's DE430 by default. Additional ephemerides 
can be installed using:

```bash
conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge openorb-data-de405
```

for JPL's DE405 or

```bash
conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge openorb-data-bc430
```

for Baer & Chesley (2017).

# Building from source #

For the impatient:

```
./configure gfortran opt --with-pyoorb

make
make ephem
make test
sudo make install
```

after which you'll have `oorb` installed into `/usr/local/bin` and `pyoorb`
installed into your Python's standard modules directory.  For more details,
read below.

## Prerequisites ##

To build OOrb:

  * GNU `make`
  * a Fortran 90/95 compiler (`gfortran` is best tested)
  * `curl` (usually comes with macOS and Linux by default)

To build the python bindings:

  * `python` 2.7 or >=3.5
  * `numpy`

To run unit tests:

  * `pytest`

To build the documentation:

  * `gnuplot`
  * `latex`
  * `dvips`

An easy way to bootstrap a complete build environment is with
[`conda`](https://conda.io/en/latest/), which comes preinstalled with
the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/),
or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). For example,
this will install everything that's needed (including the compilers) on a
macOS machine:

```bash
conda create -n oorb-dev python numpy pytest gfortran_osx-64
conda activate oorb-dev
```

On Linux it's probably better to use your distribution's `gfortran`; simply
omit it from the line above.

## Building ##

### OOrb Command Line Tools

In the root directory of your OOrb installation (=`OORBROOT`) run

```bash
./configure COMPILER TYPE --prefix INSTALL_PATH
```

where `COMPILER` is `gfortran`, `g95`, `intel`, `absoft`, `compaq`, `ibm`,
`lahey`, or `sun`, and `TYPE` is either `opt` for optimized code or `deb`
for code including debugging information. The `--prefix` line is optional;
if given it tells `make install` where to install the binaries and data
files after they have been built.

A commonly used configuration is:
```bash
./configure gfortran opt --prefix=/opt/oorb
```
If left unspecified, the install prefix defaults to `/usr/local`.

Once you have configured the source code, run `make` to build it:

```bash
make -j4
```

The `-j4` command line arguments tells `make` to compile up to four targets in
parallel (making a better use of today's multi-core machines).

Now you have a working executable called `oorb` in the `OORBROOT/bin/`
directory.  To do something useful, you need to provide the software
additional data files which will be prepared in the next section.


### Building `pyoorb` -- the OOrb Python Bindings

To build the Python bindings, you must configure OOrb with:

```bash
./configure COMPILER TYPE --with-pyoorb
```

They're not built by default, otherwise. Once configured, running `make` as
discussed in the previous section will both build `oorb` and `pyoorb`.


### Other `configure` options

A few other options are available with `configure`, mostly allowing you to
override default paths and/or executable names:

  * `--with-python=<python interpreter name/path>`
  * `--with-f2py=<f2py compuler name/path>`
  * `--with-pytest=<pytest executable name/path>`


### Building with test coverage logging (for developers)

Running configure with:
```bash
./configure --coverage
```
will link OpenOrb with [`gcov`
coverage](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) libraries. These
allow the developers to monitor the extent to which the code is covered by
the test suite.

See additional information in the comments next to the `coverage` target in
the [Makefile](Makefile).

## Generating and updating additional data files after building from source ##

### Planetary ephemerides ###

The [DE405](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planet_eph_export) planetary
ephemerides provided by the [Solar System Dynamics
Group](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory need to be
converted to binary format (e.g., `de405.dat`) only once by doing:

```bash
make ephem
```

### BC430 Asteroid ephemerides ### 

Usage of the BC430 asteroid ephemerides (Baer & Chesley, 2017)
requires the files `asteroid_ephemeris.txt`, `asteroid_masses.txt`,
and `asteroid_indices.txt`. These can be obtained as follows:

> cd `OORBROOT/data/`

> `./getBC430`

or alternatively directly through Baer's Google drive at
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZIpK99YNwYnxNLsaMsxfrY6fJ-wGRNWNcDzWmGvP9s/edit

### IAU/MPC Observatory codes and positions ###

The [Minor Planet Center](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.html) updates the [observatory codes](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html) on a daily basis, but an update is not necessarily required until you stumble upon observations from an observatory which isn't listed in your version of the file.

> `cd OORBROOT/data/`

> `./updateOBSCODE`

updates a file called `OBSCODE.dat`.

### ET minus UT ###

Update via the OOrb git repository by

> `git pull ET-UT.dat`

### TAI minus UTC ###

Update via the OOrb git repository by

> `git pull TAI-UTC.dat`

## Installing and Setting Up

### Installing

To install the binaries and data files to their destination directory, run:

```bash
make install
```

This will copy all that's needed into the directory given by `--prefix` to
`./configure` (or `/usr/local`, if none was given). As most Unix
distributions have `/usr/local/bin` on the default path, you should now be able
to run oorb by typing `oorb`.

If configured to build `pyoorb`, `pyoorb` will be installed into the default
`site-path` path of the Python used to build it. This means you'll be able
to `import pyoorb` from Python without any special setup. If you wish to
install `pyoorb` elsewhere, you can customize its install path with:

```bash
env PYTHON_SITE_PATH=/where/pyoorb/should/be/installed make install 
```

Note that you will have to add that path to `PYTHONPATH`, to make `pyoorb`
discoverable to Python.

### Running from the source directory ##

If you wish to run `oorb` from the source directory, you need to tell it
where to find the different files.  This is easiest to do through
environment variables which you declare in the configuration file for the
shell (e.g., `.profile` on Mac OS X and `.bash_profile` on Linux).  For the
Bash shell you need to add the following lines to the configuration file of
your shell:

```bash
export OORB_DATA=OORBROOT/data
export OORB_CONF=OORBROOT/main/oorb.conf
export OORB_GNUPLOT_SCRIPTS_DIR=OORBROOT/gnuplot/
```

# Using oorb #

The full path to the OOrb configuration file is specified by

  1. the `--conf=CONFIGURATIONFILE` command-line parameter
  1. the `$OORB_CONF` environment variable
  1. the current directory assuming the default name (`oorb.conf`)

in this order. That is, option #1 overrides #2 which overrides #3. The path to the default configuration file is `OORBROOT/main/oorb.conf`.

## --task=ranging ##

To compute an orbital solution given astrometric observations, do

> `oorb --task=ranging --obs-in=OBSERVATIONFILE --orb-out=ORBITFILE`

where `OBSERVATIONFILE` (use of suffix, such as **.mpc or**.des, is mandatory!) contains the input astrometry and `ORBITFILE` contains the resulting sampled orbital-element probability-density function (PDF) in OOrb format. The orbits will be written to standard out if `--orb-out=` is omitted.

If astrometry of several different objects is included in OBSERVATIONFILE, then a command like

> `oorb --task=ranging --obs-in=OBSERVATIONFILE --separately`

will process each object separately and write the output to a separate set of files. The separation into different objects is done using the numbers and/or designations. If both are specified for a line of astrometry, then the number overrides the designation.

## --task=lsl ##

> `oorb --task=lsl --obs-in=OBSERVATIONFILE --orb-in=ORBITFILEIN --orb-out=ORBITFILEOUT`


## --task=propagation ##

> `oorb --task=propagation --orb-in=ORBITFILEIN --epoch-mjd-tt=MJD --orb-out=ORBITFILEOUT`


## --task=ephemeris ##

Topocentric ephemerides _without_ uncertainty information for, e.g., Mauna Kea (observatory code 568) for the orbital-element epoch are generated by issuing the command:

> `oorb --task=ephemeris --code=568 --G=GVALUE --orb-in=ORBITFILE`

where `ORBITFILE` (use of suffix, either .orb or .des, is mandatory!) contains the orbits in either the OpenOrb format or DES format and `GVALUE` refers to the slope parameter in the H,G system (default=0.15). The default for `--code` is 500, which corresponds to the geocenter. It is also possible to compute ephemerides simultaenously for a range of dates:

> `oorb --task=ephemeris --code=568 --timespan=TIMESPAN --step=STEP --orb-in=ORBITFILE`

Here `TIMESPAN` specifies how many days into the past (`TIMESPAN` < 0 days) or future (`TIMESPAN` > 0 days) you wish to compute ephemerides, and `STEP` specifies the time interval (in days) between ephemerides. The default is to use an integrator for propagations of the orbital elements, but it is also possible to use the analytical two-body approach by making changes to the configuration file.

The ephemerides are written to stdout unless the `--separately` option is specified (in which case every object in the input file gets its own output file).

The output is divided into the following columns (as marked by a single-line header)
  * **Designation** is the designation for the orbit/object as specified in the input file,
  * **Code** is the official observatory code assigned by IAU/MPC,
  * **MJD UTC/UT1** is the UTC (or UT1 before year 1972) ephemeris date (Modified Julian Date),
  * **Delta**, **RA** and **Dec** are the topocentric equatorial spherical coordinates (AU, deg, deg),
  * **dDelta/dt**, **dRA/dt** and **dDec/dt** are the instantaneous topocentric equatorial spherical sky velocities (for coordinate velocities, divide **dRA/dt** with the cosine of **Dec**) (AU/day, 2 x deg/day),
  * **VMag** is the apparent brightness (mag),
  * **Alt** is the altitude of the object (pure geometric altitude where Earth is assumed spherical) (deg),
  * **Phase** is the phase angle of the object (deg),
  * **LunarElon** is the lunar elongation (angular distance between the Moon and the object) (deg),
  * **LunarAlt** is the lunar altitude (pure geometric altitude where Earth is assumed spherical) (deg),
  * **LunarPhase** is the lunar phase where 0 is new moon and 1 is full moon,
  * **SolarElon** is the solar elongation (angular distance between the Sun and the object) (deg),
  * **SolarAlt** is the altitude of the Sun (pure geometric altitude where Earth is assumed spherical) (deg),
  * **r**, **HLon**, and **HLat** are the heliocentric ecliptic spherical coordinates (AU, deg, deg),
  * **TLon** and **TLat** are the topocentric ecliptic spherical coordinates (2 x deg),
  * **TOCLon** and **TOCLat** are the topocentric opposition-centered ecliptic spherical coordinates (2 x deg),
  * **HOCLon** and **HOCLat** are the heliocentric opposition-centered ecliptic spherical coordinates (2 x deg),
  * **TOppLon** and **TOppLat** are the topocentric ecliptic spherical coordinates for the opposition direction (2 x deg),
  * **HEclObj X Y Z dX/dt dY/dt dZ/dt** are the heliocentric ecliptic cartesian coordinates for the object (3 x AU, 3 x AU/day), and
  * **HEclObsy X Y Z** are the heliocentric ecliptic cartesian coordinates for the observer (3 x AU).

## Usage ##


### How do I include asteroidal perturbations in my computation? ###

The new asteroidal perturbations feature may be enabled by toggling
perturber.asteroids in the configuration file. Note that downloading
the BC430 asteroid ephemerides is necessary for this purpose (see data
files section). The file `asteroid_indices.txt` contains the
designations of each massive asteroid included in BC430 in descending
order in terms of mass. To exclude perturbations of individual
asteroid(s), comment out their corresponding lines with a hash (\#).

Note that this is a very new feature and bugs may exist. Should
problems arise, please raise an issue on Github.


### Can I input multiple observation files simultaneously? ###

Yes. Simply add each observation file into --obs-in separated by
commas and OpenOrb will seamlessly include observations from each file
into the computation.

> `oorb --obs-in=OBSERVATIONFILE1,OBSERVATIONFILE2,OBSERVATIONFILE3`


### Can I specify a date for which I want an ephemeris to be computed? ###

No. At the moment the only option is to first explicitly propagate the orbits to the desired date by using, e.g.,

> `oorb --task=propagation --epoch-mjd-utc=DATE --orb-in=ORBITFILEIN --orb-out=ORBITFILEOUT`

and then compute the ephemeris using, e.g.,

> `oorb --task=ephemeris --orb-in=ORBBITFILEOUT`

Note that there is no algorithmic reason why you couldn't specify an option like `--epoch-mjd-utc=DATE` to `--task=ephemeris`. The option just doesn't exist (yet!).

### I've been seeing the following warning message quite frequently: "Could not find inverse of inverse covariance matrix." Should I be concerned, or is this normal? ###

This is normal and has to do with the numerical instability of the matrix
inversion. The information matrix, for which the inversion fails, typically has a large condition number, that is, the inversion results are not accurate, and in this particular case a solution cannot even be found. For a sampling method the impact of the failure on the overall results is expected to be negligible because a successful solution can probably be obtained in the immediate vicinity of the failed one.


### Is there an OOrb Users mailing list? ###

Yes there is. Go to http://groups.google.com/group/oorb.


## Miscellaneous ##

### Why are the Python wrappers not working anymore? ###

The Python wrappers are under heavy development and change fairly frequently. Use the command-line executable if you need a more stable platform.
